# Testing

## Unit test
Unit testing test the smallest *units* of our code. A unit can be a function, class, or some other basic building block of our program.

We use unit test to find bugs earlier and prevent *regression* (change of implementation break something). Please write the unit test first before writing the actual code.

We use the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) test framework to run tests and make assertions. Please see the guide on the official website. All of those test frameworks are similar, but if you do not have any unit test experiences before, you may need read additional materials about the best practices of unit testing.

### Unit Test for React Components
We use the [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) library to help to test React components.
