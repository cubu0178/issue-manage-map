During this meeting we worked on milestone one. We decided that we wanted to make an interactive map that allowed users to report maintenance issues around where they live/work. We spent about an hour working together on a google doc to answer all the questions for milestone one.

Tentative steps:

Step 1: static web page
We will harness HTML and CSS to make a static website that responsive to different screen sizes. During this first step, we will focus on the CSS layout of the whole application, and home, about, and 404 pages. We have not decided to put login as a page or a component. We also need to finish some components shared through pages, like Navigation, Header, and Footer.

Step 2:
Map integration ( static or dynamic map)
Drop down list that will set a pin

Step 3:
Comment

We still need to assign tasks and start working on the website.
