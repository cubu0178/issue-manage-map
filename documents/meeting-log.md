Met at 6pm in HUMN 245
Members in attendance: Kevin, Lesley, Madie, Daniel, Nolan
During this meeting we worked on milestone one. We decided that we wanted to make an interactive map that allowed users to report maintenance issues around where they live/work. We spent about an hour working together on a google doc to answer all the questions for milestone one.

Virtual meeting at 7pm

Tentative steps:

Step 1: static web page
We will harness HTML and CSS to make a static website that responsive to different screen sizes. During this first step, we will focus on the CSS layout of the whole application, and home, about, and 404 pages. We have not decided to put login as a page or a component. We also need to finish some components shared through pages, like Navigation, Header, and Footer.

Step 2:
Map integration ( static or dynamic map)
Drop down list that will set a pin

Step 3:
Comment

We still need to assign tasks and start working on the website.

## February 26th, 2018
Members in attendance: Kevin, Lesley, Madie, Daniel, Nolan, Curry
We talked about the strategy of dividing our tasks and allocate them to our group. Madie provides a design of the layout of our page. We make her our “CSS master” about that and she will keep charge of the style of our website.
