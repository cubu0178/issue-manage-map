# Meeting Log

## February 15th, 2018
Met at 6pm in HUMN 245
Members in attendance: Kevin, Lesley, Madie, Daniel, Nolan
During this meeting we worked on milestone one. We decided that we wanted to make an interactive map that allowed users to report maintenance issues around where they live/work. We spent about an hour working together on a google doc to answer all the questions for milestone one.

## February 22th, 2018
Virtual meeting at 7pm
Members in attendance: Kevin, Lesley, Curry, Madie

Tentative steps:

Step 1: static web page
We will harness HTML and CSS to make a static website that responsive to different screen sizes. During this first step, we will focus on the CSS layout of the whole application, and home, about, and 404 pages. We have not decided to put login as a page or a component. We also need to finish some components shared through pages, like Navigation, Header, and Footer.

Step 2:
Map integration ( static or dynamic map)
Drop down list that will set a pin

Step 3:
Comment

We still need to assign tasks and start working on the website.

## February 26th, 2018
Members in attendance: Kevin, Lesley, Madie, Daniel, Nolan, Curry
We talked about the strategy of dividing our tasks and allocate them to our group. Madie provides a design of the layout of our page. We make her our “CSS master” about that and she will keep charge of the style of our website.

## Sometime in March, 2018
Members met before milestone 3 to address what we would be demonstaring for the TA.

## April 6th, 2018

Members in attendance: Lesley, Kevin, Nolan, Curry, Daniel

We communicated on the development for milestone 4 and brought together our thoughts on the database. Nolan brought us up to speed on how each of our three databases stores data. Curry will be populating the database with users. Kevin and lesley will be attempting to connect the database with the login screen. Our website has a html skin on it but is not yet functional. There are multiple pages that have working go between links. Security is in the back of our minds but passwords may start as plain text before we attmet to add a hash function to it.
